  <p style="font-size:500%">about me</p>
  <p style="position:relative; bottom:60px;"> I was born in the harsh canadian wilderness where it is so cold that you physically cannot feel warm even with multiple layers of jackets. My birth parents quickly left, so I was left to fend for my self. I quickly found a pack of moose at their camp, who were gaming on their $3000 gaming PC setups, complete with RGB fans, keyboards, headphones and mice. I made a crude spear out of branches and stones, and took control of the camp I managed to steal a PC and was running back when a moose yelled <strong> "If you come back, we will make a truce!" </strong> </p>
    <p style="position:relative; bottom:76px;">I decided that having a team with me would be beneficial, so I went back in attempt to team up with the moose. <strong>But it was a trap</strong> They had a cage right above my exact position and dropped it at the exact time and trapped me inside of it. The moose had started a mining operation in the time I wasn't looking and had managed to make steel bars for the cage. They said <strong>"Muahahaha we have got you now"</strong> I couldn't believe my eyes. They had betrayed me. Since they had no attention span the moose started playing Minecraft on lan. But I knew I could escape. I patiently waited until the moose went to go to sleep, and then I used some sticks to make a longer stick and hacked into the moose computers. I then ordered a drill from Amazon but unfortunately there was no same day delivery so I went to sleep.
<p style="position:relative; bottom:76px;">At 3am Amazon said that my package was packaged and being delivered. Unfortunately the estimated delivery date was tomorrow still so I closed the tab and went to sleep. <strong>The next day I realised my mistake</strong> I forgot to delete the search history so the moose knew that I was trying to escape. They built another cage and caged the cage I was in with another cage. The moose leader soon came and said <strong>"I know what you've been doing"</strong> It seemed like there was no use. They put a password on the computer and removed all sticks from the area. I sat there, in defeat. But I held out hope and just waited for an opportunity to strike. And eventually, I found it. The moose were moving their PC setups and I managed to grab one that they placed near me. I quickly dug a hole to hide it in, waiting for when they went to sleep. 12 hours later, they did and I took a full course on digging and upgraded my digging power by 700%. I quickly dug under and out of the cages with my PC, and escaped. I made a pickaxe and mined some silicon to create a wifi router, and setup a video making studio with the head phones i got from the moose HQ. That leads me to today, where I make youtube videos to maybe one day fight back againts the moose. </div>
